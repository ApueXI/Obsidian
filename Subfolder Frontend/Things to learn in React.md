### Things to learn in React

### ðŸ”¥ Useful React Skills to Focus on (Beyond Basics)

1. **React Context & useContext Hook**
    - Manage app-wide state (like theme, auth status) without prop drilling.
    - Useful for medium-sized apps that donâ€™t need heavy state libraries.
2. **React Router (v6+) Advanced**
    - Nested routes, route guards (protected routes), lazy loading routes.
    - Understand URL parameters, query strings, and redirects.
3. **State Management Libraries**
    - **Redux Toolkit:** Simplifies Redux with less boilerplate.
    - Or alternatives like **Zustand** or **Recoil** for easier global state.
    - Useful once your app grows complex.
4. **React Query / TanStack Query**
    - Manage server state and caching elegantly.
    - Handles fetching, caching, syncing with backend data.
    - Helps reduce boilerplate and improve UX.
5. **Forms in React**
    - Beyond simple forms, learn **react-hook-form** or **Formik** for robust validation and performance.
    - Better than manually managing inputs and validations.
6. **Error Boundaries & Suspense**
    - Catch UI errors gracefully without crashing the whole app.
    - Use Suspense for lazy-loading components and code splitting.

7. **Custom Hooks**
    - Build reusable logic across components.
    - Improves code cleanliness and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle.
8. **Testing React Components**
    - Learn to write tests using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
    - Start with unit tests for components & integration tests.
9. **Performance Optimization**
    - React.memo, useMemo, useCallback to avoid unnecessary renders.
    - Code-splitting and lazy loading with React.lazy and Suspense.
10. **Accessibility (a11y)**
    - Learn basics of making your apps accessible (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
    - Improves usability and is often required in professional projects.

### Bonus: Build a small project that uses these skills

For example:

- A **multi-page dashboard** with React Router + React Query fetching fake APIs.
- Forms with react-hook-form and client-side validation.
- Global theme toggler using Context API.
- Lazy-loaded components and error boundaries for UX polish.

### TL;DR for your summer break:

- Deepen **React fundamentals + routing + forms**
- Explore **state management + data fetching** libraries
- Learn **testing + performance tricks + accessibility**
- Build a polished frontend project showcasing these skills
