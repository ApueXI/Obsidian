## Data Structure and Algorithm

## ✅ **1. Programming Foundations (before DSA)**

- Variables, loops, conditionals
- Functions & parameters
- Arrays & strings basics
- Recursion (very important for later)
- Time & space complexity (**Big-O notation**)

💡 _Goal: Be able to write simple programs confidently._

---

## ✅ **2. Basic Data Structures**

Start with structures you already use in web dev (arrays & objects), then go deeper:

- **Arrays / Lists**
    - Traversal, insertion, deletion, searching
    - Prefix sum & sliding window
- **Strings**
    - Substrings, reversing, pattern matching (e.g. `KMP`)
- **Stacks**
    - LIFO concept, bracket matching, undo feature
- **Queues**
    - FIFO concept, circular queue, deque
- **Hash Tables (HashMap/Set)**
    - Key-value mapping, frequency counting

💡 _Goal: Be comfortable implementing & using these basic structures._

## ✅ **3. Fundamental Algorithms**

Now learn classic algorithm patterns:

- **Sorting**
    - Bubble, Insertion, Selection (easy)
    - Merge Sort, Quick Sort (divide & conquer)
- **Searching**
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search (and its variants)
- **Two-Pointer Technique**
    - Used in arrays & strings
- **Recursion + Backtracking**
    - Factorials, Fibonacci
    - N-Queens, Subset generation

💡 _Goal: Understand how algorithmic patterns work._

## ✅ **4. Advanced Data Structures**

Level up with more complex structures:

- **Linked List (Singly & Doubly)**
- **Trees**
    - Binary Tree basics (DFS, BFS traversals)
    - Binary Search Tree (BST)
    - Heaps / Priority Queues
    - Tries (for strings/prefix search)
- **Graphs**
    - Representation (adjacency list/matrix)
    - DFS, BFS
    - Shortest path (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)
    - Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal, Prim)
- **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**

💡 _Goal: Handle hierarchical and network-like data efficiently._

## ✅ **5. Important Algorithm Paradigms**

These are the big problem-solving strategies:

- **Greedy Algorithms**
    - Activity selection, Huffman coding
- **Divide & Conquer**
    - Merge sort, quick sort, binary search
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    - Memoization & tabulation
    - Classic DP problems: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Coin Change
- **Graph Algorithms**
    - Topological sort, SCCs, Bellman-Ford, A*

💡 _Goal: Learn patterns to break down complex problems._

---

## ✅ **6. Complexity & Optimization**

- Time/space complexity analysis
- Amortized analysis (e.g. dynamic array resizing)
- Bit manipulation tricks

---

## ✅ **7. Practice, Practice, Practice**

- Solve problems on **LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank**
- Follow **easy → medium → hard** progression
- Do **pattern-based learning** (e.g. “sliding window” problems, then “two pointers”)

---

## 🏆 **Optional Advanced Topics**

If you want to go deep into algorithms:

- Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees
- Advanced Graphs (Flow algorithms, Bridges, Articulation points)
- Computational Geometry (Convex Hull, Line Sweep)

### 🗺️ **Simplified DSA Learning Order**

1. Arrays & Strings → Sorting/Searching → Stacks/Queues → Recursion
2. Linked Lists → Hashing → Trees → Graphs
3. Greedy → Divide & Conquer → Dynamic Programming → Advanced Graphs
