## 1. Full Explanation

### ðŸ”¹ What is Denormalization?

- **Denormalization** is the **intentional reversal of normalization** to improve **database performance**.
- Involves **combining tables, adding redundant data, or storing computed columns**.
- Trade-off: **faster read performance** vs **higher storage and potential update anomalies**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why Denormalize?

1. **Performance:** Reduce the number of **joins** in queries.
2. **Simpler queries:** Fewer tables to join for reporting or analytics.
3. **Data warehousing:** Often used in **OLAP / reporting databases**.

**When to use:**

- Heavy read operations, complex reporting, or analytics.
- Not recommended for **transactional OLTP systems** with frequent updates.

### ðŸ”¹ Common Denormalization Techniques

|Technique|Description|
|---|---|
|Combining tables|Merge multiple normalized tables into one.|
|Adding redundant columns|Store data that could be derived from another table.|
|Precomputing aggregates|Store sums, counts, or other calculations in a table.|
|Storing computed columns|Store calculated fields instead of computing on-the-fly.|
|Using summary tables|Create tables with pre-joined or aggregated data for reporting.|

### ðŸ”¹ Example

**Normalized Tables:**

**Employees Table:**

|EmployeeID|Name|DeptID|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|1|

**Departments Table:**

|DeptID|DeptName|
|---|---|
|1|HR|

**Query to get employee name and department:**

```SQL
SELECT e.Name, d.DeptName
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;

```

**Denormalized Table (combined):**

|EmployeeID|Name|DeptID|DeptName|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|1|HR|

- Query is now **simpler** and **faster**, no join needed.
- Trade-off: **DeptName is duplicated** if multiple employees belong to HR.

### ðŸ”¹ Advantages vs Disadvantages

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|---|---|
|Faster read performance|Data redundancy|
|Simpler queries|Higher storage usage|
|Precomputed aggregates for reports|Risk of data inconsistency|
|Reduced joins|More maintenance on updates|

## âœ… Key Takeaways

- **Denormalization** improves **read performance** at the cost of **redundancy and storage**.
- Useful in **reporting, analytics, and data warehousing** scenarios.
- Common techniques: **combine tables, add redundant fields, precompute aggregates**.
- Always **weigh performance gains vs maintenance cost**.
