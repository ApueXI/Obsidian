## 1. How `for` Loop Works Internally

- Python’s `for` loop **does NOT work like a traditional C-style for loop** with counters and indices.
- Instead, it uses **iterators** and the **iterator protocol** under the hood.

---

## 2. Iterator Protocol

An **iterator** is any object that implements two methods:

- `__iter__()` → returns the iterator object itself (usually `self`)
- `__next__()` → returns the next item, raises `StopIteration` when exhausted

---

## 3. What Happens in a `for` Loop?

```Python
for item in iterable:
    # do something with item
```

Is roughly equivalent to:

```Python
_it = iter(iterable)          # calls iterable.__iter__()
while True:
    try:
        item = next(_it)      # calls _it.__next__()
    except StopIteration:
        break
    # do something with item
```

---

## 4. Summary of Steps

|Step|What Happens|
|---|---|
|`iter(iterable)`|Get iterator from the iterable|
|`next(iterator)`|Retrieve next item from iterator|
|`StopIteration` caught|Loop ends when no more items|
|Body executed with item|Loop body runs using the current item|

---

## 5. Why This Matters

- This is why **any object with** `**__iter__**` **and** `**__next__**` **methods can be iterated over** (even custom classes).
- It explains why some objects are **iterable** but **not iterators** (e.g., lists are iterable but not iterators themselves).
- Explains behavior of generator functions, which produce iterators naturally.

---

## 6. Real-World Example: Manual iteration vs for loop

```Python
lst = [10, 20, 30]

# Using for loop
for x in lst:
    print(x)

# Equivalent manual iteration
it = iter(lst)
while True:
    try:
        x = next(it)
        print(x)
    except StopIteration:
        break
```

Output for both:

```Plain
10
20
30
```

## Summary Table

|Concept|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Iterable|Object with `__iter__()` method|List, string, dict|
|Iterator|Object with `__next__()` and `__iter__()`|Generator, file object|
|`iter()`|Returns an iterator from an iterable|`it = iter([1,2,3])`|
|`next()`|Gets next item or raises `StopIteration`|`next(it)`|
|`for` loop|Uses `iter()` and `next()` internally|`for x in iterable:`|
