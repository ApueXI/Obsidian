### ðŸ”¹ What are Aggregate Functions?

- Aggregate functions **perform calculations on multiple rows** and return a **single value**.
- Commonly used with `GROUP BY` for summarizing data.

### ðŸ”¹ Common Aggregate Functions

|Function|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`COUNT()`|Counts rows|`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;`|
|`SUM()`|Sum of values|`SELECT SUM(price) FROM orders;`|
|`AVG()`|Average of values|`SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;`|
|`MIN()`|Minimum value|`SELECT MIN(price) FROM products;`|
|`MAX()`|Maximum value|`SELECT MAX(age) FROM users;`|

**Notes:**

- Often used with `GROUP BY` to calculate per category or group.
- Can be combined with `WHERE` for filtered calculations.

## 2. Summary Table (Quick Reference)

|Function|Syntax / Example|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|COUNT|`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;`|Counts all rows|
|SUM|`SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;`|Total sum of column|
|AVG|`SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;`|Average value|
|MIN|`SELECT MIN(price) FROM products;`|Smallest value|
|MAX|`SELECT MAX(price) FROM products;`|Largest value|
|GROUP BY|`SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;`|Aggregate per group|

## 3. Real-World Example

Suppose we have an **Orders table**:

|order_id|customer|amount|status|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|100|completed|
|2|Bob|50|pending|
|3|Alice|200|completed|
|4|Charlie|150|completed|
|5|Bob|75|completed|

### Step 1: Count total orders

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders;

```

âœ… Returns: 5

### Step 2: Sum of all completed orders

```SQL
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_completed
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed';

```

âœ… Returns: 100 + 200 + 150 + 75 = 525

### Step 3: Average order amount

```SQL
SELECT AVG(amount) AS avg_order
FROM orders;

```

âœ… Returns: (100 + 50 + 200 + 150 + 75) / 5 = 115

### Step 4: Min and Max amount

```SQL
SELECT MIN(amount) AS min_amount, MAX(amount) AS max_amount
FROM orders;

```

âœ… Returns: Min = 50, Max = 200

### Step 5: Count orders per customer (GROUP BY)

```SQL
SELECT customer, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer;

```

âœ… Returns:

- Alice â†’ 2
- Bob â†’ 2
- Charlie â†’ 1

## âœ… Key Takeaways

- Aggregate functions **summarize data** across rows.
- `GROUP BY` is used to calculate aggregates **per category or group**.
- Can be filtered using `WHERE` before aggregation.
- Common functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`.
