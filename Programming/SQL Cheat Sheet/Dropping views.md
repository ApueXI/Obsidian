## 1. Full Explanation

### üîπ What is `DROP VIEW`?

- `DROP VIEW` **removes a view** from the database.
- The **underlying base tables are NOT affected**.
- Once dropped, the view **cannot be queried** unless recreated.

### üîπ General Syntax

```SQL
-- Drop a single view
DROP VIEW view_name;

-- Drop multiple views at once (some DBMS support this)
DROP VIEW view_name1, view_name2;

-- Optional safety in some DBMS
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS view_name;

```

**Notes:**

- `IF EXISTS` prevents an error if the view **does not exist**.
- Dropping a view **does not delete any data** in the base tables.
- Any **dependent objects** (like other views or stored procedures referencing the view) may fail if the view is dropped.

## 2. Summary Table (Quick Reference)

|Operation|Syntax / Example|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Drop a single view|`DROP VIEW view_name;`|Removes view, base tables unaffected|
|Drop multiple views|`DROP VIEW view1, view2;`|Some DBMS support multiple views|
|Drop view safely|`DROP VIEW IF EXISTS view_name;`|Prevents error if view does not exist|
|Effect on underlying tables|None|Only view definition is removed|
|Effect on dependent objects|May break references|Check dependencies before dropping|

## 3. Real-World Example

Suppose we have a view **employee_summary**:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW employee_summary AS
SELECT name, department FROM employees;

```

### Step 1: Drop the view

```SQL
DROP VIEW employee_summary;

```

‚úÖ The view `employee_summary` is removed.

### Step 2: Querying the view after dropping

```SQL
SELECT * FROM employee_summary;

```

‚ùå Error: `View 'employee_summary' does not exist.`

### Step 3: Drop safely if unsure

```SQL
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS employee_summary;

```

‚úÖ No error occurs if the view was already deleted.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- `DROP VIEW` **removes a view** without affecting base tables.
- Use `IF EXISTS` to **avoid errors** if the view may not exist.
- Check for **dependent objects** before dropping a view to prevent breaking queries or stored procedures.
- Simple, safe, and effective for **cleanup and maintenance** of database objects.
